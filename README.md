# Umbraco Google maps routeplanner property editor
==================================================


Routeplanner property editor for Umbraco backoffice
The property editor will enable you to draw a route in the Umbraco backoffice, and later on get it rendered on one of your pages.
The editor tries to be as flexible as possible, to enable as many possibilities as possible.
Loading the google map has been inspired from the many Google Maps modules for the Umbraco Backoffice, and the functionality was inspired by a running site i used to utilize.

The editor was developed as a routeplanner for running. This means that you could go draw you route, and get the length of it. Later on you could input the duration of the run, and render it on your website. Its great for looking back at how you preformed earlier.
